The IMGUI System has not been created by me. Thus I will not deliver it within my repository. 
Maybe I will link from my repository to the IMGUI repository later.

Installation
=============
For now you have to install the IMGUI files by yourself. 
This is very easy: Just download the ZIP file from https://github.com/ocornut/imgui and copy all files inside the directory of the ZIP file into this directory.

At least the following files must be present in this directory:
 -	imconfig.h
 -	imgui.cpp
 -	imgui.h
 -	imgui_draw.cpp
 -	imgui_demo.cpp
 -	imgui_internal.h
 -	stb_rect_pack.h
 -	stb_textedit.h
 -	stb_truetype.h
 -	extra_fonts/Cousine-Regular.ttf
 -	extra_fonts/ DroidSans.ttf
 -	extra_fonts/ Karla-Regular.ttf
 -	extra_fonts/ ProggyClean.ttf
 -	extra_fonts/ ProggyTiny.ttf

Otherwise the binding will not compile or the examples will not run (without the extra fonts).

License
========
Please consider that the IMGUI system (created by Omar Cornut) and the extra fonts may use a different license then the IMGUI Irrlicht bindings.
